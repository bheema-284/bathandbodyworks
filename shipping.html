<h3>ADDITIONAL SHIPPING GUIDELINES</h3>


</div>
            <hr>
            <p>Delivery Estimates are based on two factors: order processing time and time in transit. In Stock items will be shipped once the item is located, your payment is approved, and the receiving address is verified. For most orders, this process begins once your online order has been submitted. Depending on the time you place your order, the order process might not start until the following business day. Business days are Monday-Friday, excluding United States federal holidays. During peak periods you may experience longer than average order processing time.</p>
    <p>Bath & Body Works will determine the most efficient method of delivery based on your shipping address.</p>       
     <p>Shipping & handling will be charged at the time of shipment. If your order includes a pre-order or backordered item, shipping & handling charges will be assessed for the entire order at the time of the initial shipment. You will not be charged for an item until it is shipped.</p>  
      <p>Shipping & handling is a taxable service.</p>  
       <p>Certain beauty products are not eligible to be shipped to PO Boxes, APO/FPO, Alaska, Hawaii, Canada or US Territories.</p>  
        <p>Gift Cards will receive free standard ground shipping & handling. When other items are ordered along with Gift Cards, sales tax and shipping & handling charges will be applied to the value of the other items, not the Gift Cards. Express shipping & handling options are available for Gift Cards shipped within the lower 48 states, excluding PO Boxes, for an additional fee of $8 for Express (2-Day) and $13.50 for Overnight. These charges are in addition to the shipping & handling charges for your merchandise. Please note funds may take up to 48 hours to appear on your Gift Card, even if you ship overnight.</p>  
         <p>Using a freight forwarder to ship items internationally may result in issues not covered by Bath & Body Works. If you use a package forwarding service to ship your order outside of the United States, then we consider their U.S. address to be the destination for your order. Our responsibility for loss or damage to your order ends once it reaches that address safely. We will not provide a replacement or refund for any items or packages delivered to you from a freight forwarder. You should refuse any items or packages that arrive damaged and instruct freight forwarders to do the same. Any items lost after delivery to you or the freight forwarder will be your responsibility.</p>
